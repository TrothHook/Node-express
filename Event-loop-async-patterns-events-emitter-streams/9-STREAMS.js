// STREAMS IN NODE.JS

// Writeable
// Readable
// Duplex --> Both read and write data sequentially
// Transform --> Data can be modified while writing or reading

// Streams are used to Read or Write sequentially

// When we have to handle and manipulate streaming data like --> continuous source or big file --> 

// Just like with events, many built in modules in Node.js implement streaming interface

// Also interesting is that, STREAMS extends event emitters class meaning --> we can use events like data and **** on streams
