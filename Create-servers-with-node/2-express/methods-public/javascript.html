<!-- Here in this form, we don't have the action, we don't have the method , We have name attribute still with a value of name. So, we should expect the key value pair. There should expect that this is going to be the value that's coming in when the request is performed

Then we have a little bit of form alert where we will display a little bit of functionality 

and we have the result as well

There is a package called axios which essentially makes it easier to set up http request.

So, instead of using the built in fetch, Axios provides cleaner api and better error messages. using cdn link to use axios in the frontend -> it is NOT a backend project.

With the axios cdn link, we get access to the axios library-->

<!-- We have selected the result, that is the div. 
  
And we also have this  fetchPeople function, that is the function that fetches people from our server

Notice the path -> It is /api/people -> why? -> because in our server we also have this path /api/people . So, this is for get request, that is the default one.

However, in this case we are not doing this with the browser, we are doing this with javascript.

Axios has the get method, and through this method we are making the http request (and we are not doing this with the browser)-->

<!-- Then we have to use the form -> DOM Manipulation -->
